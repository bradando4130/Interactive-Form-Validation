- checking of name, email and credit card fields with Regex
- enabling and disabling extra input options based on prerequisites
- providing helpful error messages on keyup for text fields
- preventing default submission of form when submission criteria not met
- disabling certain inputs that conflicted with selected inputs
- conditional error messages for email input
